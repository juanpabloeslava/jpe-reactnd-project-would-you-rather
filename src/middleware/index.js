// The middleware is called in the order it is listed in this function. The thunk action creators we're using to load initial date, save tweets, and toggle tweets are functions. So if they go to the logger middleware before going to the thunk middleware (which takes the functions and executes them, thereby obtaining actions to pass to the reducers), we're going to be logging function, not the actual actions.
